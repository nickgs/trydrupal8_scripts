Some scripts I have been playing with to spin up little test instances of Drupal 8 

Much of the scripts here were developed to address (and learn) issues with Docker while running TryDrupal8.com. With newer version of Docker alot of the way things are done here can be acheived using a better method (ie linked images) 

Inspired by tryrethinkdb.info.
